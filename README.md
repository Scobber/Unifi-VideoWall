## UniFi Video Evostreamer

This example uses 'evostream.js' to complete the video streaming.

load.php - loads the camera matrix
OpenCameraByID.php - Sets up the evovideo based on camera ID
const.php - important settings and layout options
streams.php - More like an admin utility to get stream name and id's
evo.png - Background placeholder image for when a feed is unloaded

evostream.min.js - Citation needed. not included under the license of this repository.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
I do not have unifi-video anymore. I have moved away to ZoneMinder.
